This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Import required library

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Import dataset
cases_malaysia <- read.csv("E:/UTeM/Sem 3/Statistics and Probability/A/A2/code/data/cases_malaysia.csv")
population <- read.csv("E:/UTeM/Sem 3/Statistics and Probability/A/A2/code/data/population.csv")
```

Retrieve data based on desired range which is 01-02-2020 to 30-11-2021 only.

```{r}
cases_MY <- cases_malaysia[cases_malaysia$date >= "2020-02-01" & cases_malaysia$date <= "2021-11-30",]
```
